# Hotel_System
Hotel management system created in python. It had two modes, admin mode and the user mode. Admin can add, remove the hotels and also delete the bookings of the user. User had to first make an account and then he can book a new hotel or he can view his old bookings. User could pay through debit/credit card or the booking can be post paid. For database, MySql was used to keep track of the users, their bookings and also of the hotels.
